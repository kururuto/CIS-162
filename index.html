<h2>About Me</h2>  
<section>
<p>Hello my name is Timothy Wang, it my 2nd year in cerritos college. I'm currently working at a restaunt bar almost every single night from 5 Pm - 1 Am. I can speak mandarin, but other than that I think I'm average at everything. My hobbie is play video games and learn some new things. Hopefully I can learn new stuff here to improve myself. Hope we can have a great sepmaster this year.</p>
